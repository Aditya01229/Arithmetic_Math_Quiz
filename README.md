# Arithmetic_Math_Quiz
This is code for Math quiz for operators Addition, Substraction, Division, Multiplication and Square based on programming language C. This project was made for college FP PBL . 
The user will be asked 10 questions on any operator user prefer . And for each operator levels from 1 to 3 have been framed. So the user can select any level as per his choice.
This program gives the accuracy and time requiredby the user to perform all that questions. This is a useful application for basic operators question practice.
File handling is also done in order to save all the results for this the user will be asked his name, So his results will get saved in the files which can be tracked later using the program.
There is also an option to reset all the files.

IMPORTANT FOR PREVENTING ANY ERRORS!
1) When the user is asked his/her name only type the First name without any space. (Space can create an issue while extracting the data from file during displaying it in console)
2) If the program gets any error just reset the files by  running the program, then press 3 and enter, and 1- enter for confirmation. All the issues will files will get solve with this!

If you find the program useful and have any issue regarding it, feel free to talk to me!
Thank you!
